## ðŸš€ **How to Run the Examples**

### **ðŸ”¹ Prerequisites**
Ensure you have:
- Rust installed (`rustc --version` to check)
- A CAN interface (or a software CAN simulator)
- Built the SpaceCAN library:
  ```sh
  cargo build --release
  ```

### **ðŸ”¹ Running an Example**
To run an example, use:
```sh
cargo run --example split_packet
```
Replace `split_packet` with the desired example.
